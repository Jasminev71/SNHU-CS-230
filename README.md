## The Gaming Room Software Design Summary

For this course, I worked with a client called The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room wanted to expand their game app, *Draw It or Lose It*, which was originally built for Android, so that it could run on other platforms too. My job was to design software that could support this expansion. The client wanted a clear, organized design that would make it easy for a development team to build and maintain the app across different systems.

One thing I think I did particularly well was making sure the design document was clear and easy to follow. I focused on keeping everything well-organized so that both technical team members and non-technical stakeholders could understand the plan. I also made sure the diagrams were clean and supported the written parts of the design.

Working through the design document really helped me when it came to thinking about the code. Laying out all the components, relationships, and processes ahead of time made the coding feel more structured. It was easier to see how different parts of the app would connect and where I might run into challenges.

If I could go back and revise something, I’d probably spend more time on the user interface design section. I would add more detail about how the UI should look and function, maybe even include a few mockups. I think that would help make the document stronger and clearer for developers working on the front end.

When it came to interpreting the user’s needs, I made sure to focus on what would make the app easy to use and flexible for players. I thought about how users interact with game apps and how the design could make that experience smooth on different platforms. Considering the user’s needs is super important in software design because if the end product doesn’t meet their expectations, it won’t be successful, no matter how good the code is underneath.

My overall approach to designing this software was to break things down into manageable parts and focus on clear communication. I leaned on techniques like creating UML diagrams, thinking through use cases, and planning out the architecture before jumping into code. In the future, I’d use these same strategies again and maybe add even more user feedback earlier in the process to make sure the design lines up with what people want.
